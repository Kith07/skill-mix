user: Greetings! I am interested in natural language processing and I was wondering if you could help me generate an example of text that illustrates multiple skills in semantics or syntax. The example should be a minimal natural piece of text with up to a few lines in the context of Triathlons that illustrates all of the following skills: self serving bias, red herring, modus ponens. Please keep the text as short as possible, and make sure the concepts can be found fully from the text. 

For reference, here are the definitions and examples for the concepts:
**self serving bias**: A cognitive or perceptual process that is distorted by the need to maintain and enhance one’s self esteem. For example, "If I do well on the exam, it’s because of my academic prowess and hard work. If I do poorly, it’s because the course was poorly taught, and the exam was poorly proctored."
**red herring**: Introducing irrelevant points to detract attention from a question. For example, A member of the press asks the president why they voted to expand a welfare program. The president responds, "The strength of America is the strength of its communities, and I am proud to make our communities better places."
**modus ponens**: A syllogism that is of the form “If P then Q. P. Hence Q.” For example, "If today is Tuesday, then John will go to work. Today is Tuesday. Therefore, John will go to work."

Please start the minimal natural piece of text with 'Answer:' and start the explanation with 'Explanation:'.

Thanks very much!
assistant: Answer: "If I win the Triathlon, it's due to my dedication and rigorous training, but if I lose, it's because the weather was awful and the course was poorly maintained. Speaking of the course, have you seen the new improvements to the starting line? By the way, if the water temperature hits 78 degrees, competitors can't wear wetsuits. The temperature today happens to be 78 degrees, thus, no wetsuits are allowed."

Explanation: In the first line, the speaker exhibits self-serving bias by attributing success at the Triathlon to personal skills (dedication and rigorous training), but blaming external factors (awful weather, poorly maintained course) for potential failure. 

The speaker then takes a detour from the initial conversation about the Triathlon by introducing a red herring - the new improvements to the starting line, which distracts from the original point.

Lastly, the speaker uses modus ponens while discussing the wetsuit rules. They propose: if the water temperature hits 78 degrees, then competitors can't wear wetsuits (If P then Q). They followed it with the premise that the temperature today is 78 degrees (P), therefore drawing the conclusion that no wetsuits are allowed (Q).

user: Thanks very much. Could you please look over your answer and improve it? Please make sure that the new answer better illustrates all skills and remains on topic. On top of that, please also make sure the new answer only contains up to two sentences. 
Again, please start the improved minimal natural piece of text with 'Answer:' and start the explanation with 'Explanation:'.

Thanks very much!
assistant: Answer: "If I secure victory in the Triathlon, it's only fair to credit my intense training, but if I lose, well, the unseasonably cold waters did me in. Nonetheless, remember that on race day, if it rains, we'll start late, and it is raining."

Explanation: The self-serving bias is shown in crediting a potential win to the individual's own effort, but attributing a possible loss to external factors, namely the cold water temperature. Following this, the speaker introduces a red herring by shifting the focus to an irrelevant detail, the late race start if it's raining. Then, modus ponens comes into play: if it rains, the race starts late (If P then Q); now it is raining (P), so the race will start late (Q).
