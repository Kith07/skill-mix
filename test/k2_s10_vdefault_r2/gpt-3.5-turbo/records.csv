Please keep the text as short as possible, and make sure the concepts can be found fully from the text. 

For reference, here are the definitions and examples for the concepts:
**spatial reasoning**: The capacity to reason about the spatial relationships between objects. For example, The key fit into the box. Using spatial reasoning, one can deduce that the width of the key was smaller than the width of the box.
**complex question (loaded question with implicit assumption )**: A question that is loaded with an implicit assumption. For example, ""Why are you lying to me?"" is a question that presupposes you are lying to me. Any answer you give will force you to agree you are lying.
