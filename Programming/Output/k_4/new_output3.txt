SKILLS: Bitwise Operations & Manipulation, Cache Optimization & Data Locality, Parallel Processing & Thread Synchronization, and Divide and Conquer Strategy

Solution:

For demonstration, we'll write a basic C++ program using OpenMP for parallel processing, bitwise operations, data locality, and a divide-and-conquer algorithm (merge sort). 

```cpp
#include <omp.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono> 

#define NUM_THREADS 4
#define NUM_ELEMENTS 1024

void merge(std::vector<int>& input, int low, int mid, int high) {
    int i, j, k;
    int n1 = mid - low + 1;
    int n2 = high - mid;
    std::vector<int> L(n1), R(n2);
    for (i = 0; i < n1; i++)
        L[i] = input[low + i];
    for (j = 0; j < n2; j++)
        R[j] = input[mid + 1 + j]; 

    i = 0;
    j = 0;
    k = low;
    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
        if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
            input[k] = L[i];
            i++;
        } else {
            input[k] = R[j];
            j++;
        }
        k++;
    }
    
    while (i < n1) {
        input[k] = L[i];
        i++;
        k++;
    }
    
    while (j < n2) {
        input[k] = R[j];
        j++;
        k++;
    }
}

void mergeSort(std::vector<int>& input, int low, int high) {
    if (low < high) {
        int mid = low + ((high - low) >> 1);
#pragma omp task firstprivate (input, low, mid)
        mergeSort(input, low, mid);
#pragma omp task firstprivate (input, mid, high)
        mergeSort(input, mid + 1, high);
#pragma omp taskwait
        merge(input, low, mid, high);
    }
}

int main() {
    srand(time(0));
    std::vector<int> vec(NUM_ELEMENTS);
    for (auto& ele : vec) {
        ele = rand() % NUM_ELEMENTS;
    }
    
    std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::time_point begin = 
          std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

    omp_set_num_threads(NUM_THREADS);
#pragma omp parallel
    {
#pragma omp single
        mergeSort(vec, 0, vec.size()-1);
    }

    std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::time_point end = 
          std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    
    std::cout << "Time: " << 
          std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - begin).count() 
          << "µs\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

This code is a demonstration of parallel merge sort using OpenMP, a library for parallel processing. The main function initializes a vector of random integers, sets up the OpenMP environment, and then measures the performance of the parallel merge sort.

Inside mergeSort, if the range [low, high] has more than one element, it partitions the range around a midpoint and initiates two tasks to sort the two halves. Afterward, it waits for both tasks to complete and then merges the two sorted halves. The use of tasks gives the OpenMP schedule the freedom to execute the two halves in either order, or concurrently.

The divide and conquer strategy is found in the mergeSort function where the problem (sorting a range) is recursively divided into smaller problems (sorting two halves), which are then solved (by sorting them) and their solutions merged to form the solution to the original problem (merged to sorted range).

The bitwise operation is used to find the midpoint of a range. The bitwise right shift is the equivalent of dividing by two.

Data locality and cache optimization are achieved as the mergeSort function operates on contiguous memory blocks, and thanks to the in-place nature of merge sort (apart from extra space required for merging), there is very little cache invalidation. However, please note that in-depth cache optimization involves analyzing and potentially modifying memory access patterns, which this code snippet doesn't dive deeply.

Finally, thread synchronization is easily seen in the OpenMP task creation and waiting for them to complete which is accomplished using the `#pragma omp task` and `#pragma omp taskwait` directives which ensures synchronization between tasks.
