SKILLS: Cycle Detection in Graphs, and Error Handling & Exception Propagation,

Sure, here's a simple Python solution which demonstrates those concepts:

Solution:
```python
import cProfile
import re

def create_graph(edges):
    graph = {}
    for (src, dest) in edges:
        if src in graph:
            graph[src].append(dest)
        else:
            graph[src] = [dest]
    return graph

def cycle_exists(graph): 
    """Return True if the directed graph has a cycle. The graph must be represented as a dictionary mapping vertices to iterables of vertices."""
    color = {node: "white" for node in graph}
    def dfs(node):
        if color[node] == "gray":
            return True 
        if color[node] == "black":
            return False 
        color[node] = "gray"
        for neighbour in graph.get(node, ()):
            if dfs(neighbour):
                return True
        color[node] = "black"
        return False
    return any(dfs(node) for node in graph)

def main():
    # Construct the graph
    edges = [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'A')]
    try:
        graph = create_graph(edges)
        print(cycle_exists(graph))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

cProfile.run('main()')
```

Explanation:
In this python script, we first import two useful modules: `cProfile` for profiling and `re` for regex manipulation which we don't use in this code but it commonly accompanies cProfile for more complex applications. Then, we define a method `create_graph()` that accepts a list of edges represented as pairs of nodes and builds a dictionary-based adjacency list representation of the graph. 

The method `cycle_exists` uses depth-first search to detect cycles in the graph. It recursively visits all nodes in the graph and keeps track of nodes currently in the recursion stack (colored "gray"). If it encounters a node that is already in the recursion stack, then there is a cycle.

The `main` method constructs a graph with a cycle, runs the cycle detection logic in a try block, and catches and reports exceptions in an except block.

Finally, `cProfile.run('main()')` runs the main method under the cProfile profiler that measures function-level execution time. This gives an idea of which parts of your code take the most time to execute, which can help guide optimization efforts.
