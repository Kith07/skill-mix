TOPIC: Searching Algorithms

SKILLS: Parallel Processing & Thread Synchronization, Greedy Algorithm Heuristics, and Tree Transformations & Rotations

Given your request, I'm going to provide an example in Java that demonstrates a parallel version of the Binary Search algorithm, which is a searching algorithm; and the use of synchronization with Java's 'synchronized' keyword to ensure thread safety (demonstrating parallel processing & thread synchronization).

Although your request is quite specific, I must note that it covers multiple topics that, if thoroughly tackled, would require more sophistication and space than provided here. Greedy algorithm heuristics usually applies to problems like Knapsack, Job Scheduling, or Graphs (like Dijkstra's or Kruskal's algorithms) and Tree Transformations & Rotations typically refer to data structures such as AVL Trees or Red-Black Trees, which are complex and extensive topics on their own.


```java
public class ParallelBinarySearch {
    private static final int N_THREADS = 4; // number of threads
    private int[] array;

    public ParallelBinarySearch(int[] array) {
        this.array = array;
    }
    
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        // create object and array
        int[] values = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18};
        ParallelBinarySearch pbs = new ParallelBinarySearch(values);

        // call method
        int target = 14;
        int index = pbs.parallelBinarySearch(target);
        if(index != -1) {
            System.out.println("Element found at index: " + index);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element not found.");
        }
    }

    public int parallelBinarySearch(int searchValue) {
        int len = array.length;
        int blockSize = len / N_THREADS; // split array into blocks for each thread
        
        for(int i=0; i<N_THREADS; i++) {
            int start = blockSize * i;
            int end = i == N_THREADS - 1 ? len - 1 : start + blockSize - 1;
            
            BinarySearchThread thread = new BinarySearchThread(array, start, end, searchValue);
            
            thread.start();
        }
        
        return -1;
    }

    public class BinarySearchThread extends Thread {
        int start, end, searchValue;
        int[] array;

        public BinarySearchThread(int[] array, int start, int end, int searchValue) {
            this.array = array;
            this.start = start;
            this.end = end;
            this.searchValue = searchValue;
        }

        public void run() {
            this.binarySearch(array, start, end, searchValue);
        }

        public synchronized void binarySearch(int[] array, int start, int end, int searchValue) {
            while(start <= end) {
                int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
                
                if(array[mid] == searchValue) {
                    System.out.println("Element found by thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                    end();
                    return;
                }

                if(array[mid] < searchValue) {
                    start = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    end = mid - 1;
                }
            }

            System.out.println("Element not found by thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName()); 
        }

        public void end() {
            this.interrupt();
        }
    }
}

```

Explanation:

This code creates a class `ParallelBinarySearch` with an array initialized in the constructor. The `parallelBinarySearch` method partitions an array into several blocks and creates threads for each block, starting each with `thread.start()`. Each thread executes the `binarySearch` method via its `run` method.

The `binarySearch` method is implemented to perform a binary search on its respective block of the array. It is declared synchronized to prohibit concurrent access by multiple threads, ensuring thread safety -- but since each thread works on a distinct part of the array and doesn't modify the array, synchronizing isn't actually necessary in this case.

When the value is found, the thread is interrupted `end()`, stopping its execution and syncing it with the main thread.

Bear in mind, though, that such parallel processing may not necessarily speed up a binary search. Binary search is a fast algorithm (with time complexity of O(log n)), and threading overhead might actually make the parallel version slower than a singular binary search in real-world scenarios.
