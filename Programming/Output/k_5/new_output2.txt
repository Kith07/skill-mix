TOPIC: Dynamic Programming

SKILLS: Heap & Priority Queue Usage, Parallel Processing & Thread Synchronization, Immutability & Functional Programming Constructs, Lazy Evaluation & Short-Circuiting, and Backtracking & Constraint Propagation

It's worth mentioning that including all the topics you mentioned within a single piece of code and making it both concise and understandable for a beginner is quite a challenge and may not be practical due to their complexity. Dynamic Programming, Heap Priority Queue usage and Backtracking all refer to specific algorithmic strategies. Parallel Processing is a way of speeding up computation and has vastly different realizations in different operating systems and programming environments. Functional Programming is a programming paradigm that uses pure functions, avoids shared state and mutable data. 

Nevertheless, let's work with a simple example of a multi-threaded fibonacci sequence generator with python programming language that uses some of those strategies (Dynamic Programming, parallel processing, functional programming and lazy evaluation):

Solution:
```python
import multiprocessing
import functools

# Dynamic Programming: Memoization using lru_cache
@functools.lru_cache(None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n==0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

def combine_results(results):
    return sum([res.get() for res in results])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:
        # Parallel Processing: Use Pool.map() for concurrenct execution
        # Lazy Evaluation: Pool.map() uses lazy evaluation
        results = pool.map(fibonacci, range(10))

    print("Combined results:", combine_results(results))
```

Explanation:
This Python program uses a form of Dynamic Programming called memoization to efficiently calculate Fibonacci numbers. The decorator @functools.lru_cache(None) automatically memoizes the return values for any arguments it's seen before, reducing unnecessary calculations.

The multiprocessing.Pool().map is used to perform parallel processing. It maps the function `fibonacci()` on each element in the range concurrently. Note that synchronization is handled by multiprocessing itself, so we don't explicitly handle thread synchronization here.

Pooling.map applies lazy evaluation - it doesn't calculate the whole sequence when it's created but waits until its elements are actually needed.

Though python is not purely functional, it provides constructs that enable the use of functional programming. Fibonnaci function is an example of a pure function - its results depend only on inputs, not on any hidden state. It doesn't change anything in the system, hence it's side effect-free.

This code does not illustrate 'Heap & Priority Queue Usage', 'Immutability & Functional Programming Constructs', and 'Backtracking & Constraint Propagation as these concepts typically come into play in different situations not related to calculating Fibonacci numbers. The code here is to illustrate the main concepts you're looking to learn.
