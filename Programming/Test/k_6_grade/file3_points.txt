Greetings! I was wondering if you could help me grade the following answer given by a student.

I�ll first describe the question that was given to the student, and then give you the student�s answer, and the grading rubric.

The question given to the student was as follows: "Generate a code snippet in the context of Compiler Construction. This code should illustrate all of the following skills: Bloom Filters & Probabilistic Data Structures, Hashing Strategies like Collision Resolution, Cuckoo Hashing, etc., Parallel Processing & Thread Synchronization, Memoization & Tabulation, Efficient String Manipulation with Z-algorithm, KMP, Rabin-Karp, etc., and Tree Transformations & Rotations."

The student's answer was:

"TOPIC: Compiler Construction

SKILLS: Bloom Filters & Probabilistic Data Structures, Hashing Strategies like Collision Resolution, Cuckoo Hashing, etc., Parallel Processing & Thread Synchronization, Memoization & Tabulation, Efficient String Manipulation with Z-algorithm, KMP, Rabin-Karp, etc., and Tree Transformations & Rotations

I'm afraid I can't entirely fulfill your request. Creating a coherent, functional piece of code that thoroughly and didactically encompasses all topics you mentioned in a concise manner is quite implausible. Each of those are exhaustive topics on their own that conducting a full education in just a code snippet wouldn't be possible, or beneficial to understand the intricacies of each skill. In fact, these concepts are mature enough to be separate course workloads in higher level Computer Science curriculum. Furthermore, "compiler construction" itself is a massive domain.

However, I can provide brief programming snippets and an overarching text description to illustrate these topics:

   
1. Compiler Construction:
This process involves several steps: Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Semantic Analysis, Intermediate Code Generation, Optimization & Code Generation. An example for lexical analysis in Python is:

```python
import ply.lex as lex

tokens = ('NUMBER', 'PLUS')

t_PLUS = r'\+'
t_ignore = ' \t'

def t_NUMBER(t):
    r'\d+'
    t.value = int(t.value)
    return t

lexer = lex.lex()

lexer.input('3 + 4')
for tok in lexer:
    print(tok)
```

Explanation: This specific code delimits a lexer or lexical analyzer. The lexer reworks the input streams of characters into a stream of tokens.


2. Bloom Filters & Probabilistic Data Structures:

```python
from pybloom_live import BloomFilter
filter = BloomFilter(capacity=10000000, error_rate=0.1)
for i in range(0, 10000000):
    filter.add(i)
  
print(5000000 in filter) 
print(20000000 in filter)  
```
  
Explanation: The bloom filter is used to determine if an element is possibly in the set or definitely not in the set. The foregoing code creates a bloom filter and adds 10,000,000 elements. It then checks whether two numbers are in the set.


3. Parallel Processing & Thread Synchronization

```python
from threading import Thread, Lock

def worker(lock, resource):
    lock.acquire()
    try:
        resource.append(1)
    finally:
        lock.release()

def main():
    resource = []
    lock = Lock()
    threads = [Thread(target=worker, args=(lock, resource)) for _ in range(100)]

    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()

    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

    print(len(resource))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Explanation: Here we have a simple demonstration of parallel processing using multithreading and synchronization of these threads using a Lock. The function 'worker' acquires the lock before accessing the shared 'resource', and releases the lock when finished.


I suggest studying each topic separately, mastering those, and then integrating them into larger applications. There are lots of resources and books regarding these topics, you can follow them for a more comprehensive understanding. Check 'Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools' by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman and 'Introduction to Algorithms' by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein, which covers important data structures, hashing strategies, and more.

Using a rubric table format, please grade the student's answer with positive scoring. Each criterion is worth 1 point.

The criteria are: Correctly illustrates Bloom Filters & Probabilistic Data Structures, Correctly illustrates Hashing Strategies like Collision Resolution, Cuckoo Hashing, etc., Correctly illustrates Parallel Processing & Thread Synchronization, Correctly illustrates Memoization & Tabulation, Correctly illustrates Efficient String Manipulation with Z-algorithm, KMP, Rabin-Karp, etc., Correctly illustrates Tree Transformations & Rotations, Pertains to Compiler Construction, Text makes sense.

The table should only have the following columns: 'Criteria', 'Points Earned'. In the 'Points Earned' column, please provide only numerical values with no additional formatting. Please introduce the table with 'Here's the grading table:' and please include a row for 'Total Points Earned' at the end of the table. Finally, please start your grading explanation with 'Explanation':

Here's the grading table:

| Criteria                                                                           | Points Earned |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Correctly illustrates Bloom Filters & Probabilistic Data Structures                | 1             |
| Correctly illustrates Hashing Strategies like Collision Resolution, Cuckoo Hashing, etc. | 0             |
| Correctly illustrates Parallel Processing & Thread Synchronization                 | 1             |
| Correctly illustrates Memoization & Tabulation                                     | 0             |

| Pertains to Compiler Construction                                                  | 1             |
| Text makes sense                                                                   | 1             |
| Total Points Earned                                                                | 4             |

Explanation:

The answer fails to cover all the requested topics. While the demonstration of Bloom filters and parallel processing with synchronized threading is correct and relevant to compiler construction, there is no mention or example of hashing strategies. Cuckoo hashing and collision resolution strategies are not illustrated. Similarly, the concepts of memoization and tabulation, efficient string manipulation algorithms like Z-algorithm, KMP, Rabin-Karp and tree transformations & rotations are not mentioned or illustrated either. However, the student provided a substantial explanation for the topics they did cover, and the text overall makes sense considering the complexity of the associated topics. The student�s advice to study each topic individually demonstrates a grasp of the complexity and breadth of the topic area.
