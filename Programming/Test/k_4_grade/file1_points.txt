Greetings! I was wondering if you could help me grade the following answer given by a student.

I’ll first describe the question that was given to the student, and then give you the student’s answer, and the grading rubric.

The question given to the student was as follows: "Generate a code snippet in the context of Concurrency. This code should illustrate all of the following skills: Lazy Evaluation & Short-Circuiting, Backtracking & Constraint Propagation, Memoization & Tabulation, and Concurrency Control using Locks, Semaphores, CAS."

The student's answer was:

"TOPIC: Concurrency

SKILLS: Lazy Evaluation & Short-Circuiting, Backtracking & Constraint Propagation, Memoization & Tabulation, and Concurrency Control using Locks, Semaphores, CAS

Sure, here you go. Python is the programming language used for this illustration.
```python
# Solution:

import threading
import time
from functools import lru_cache # For memoization

class Semaphore:
    def __init__(self, initial):
        self.lock = threading.Condition(threading.Lock())
        self.value = initial

    def P(self): # acquire
        with self.lock:
            while self.value == 0:
                self.lock.wait()
            self.value = self.value - 1

    def V(self): # release
        with self.lock:
            self.value = self.value + 1
            self.lock.notify()

@lru_cache(maxsize=None) # Memoization: save previous results
def fib(n):
    if n < 2: # Short-Circuiting: if n is less than 2 return n
        return n
    first, second = fib(n-2), fib(n-1)
    if first is not None and second is not None: # Constraint Propagation: solution must satisfy both if conditions
        return first + second # Tabulation: Subproblem solutions used to construct solutions to bigger problem
    else:
        return None # Backtracking: no solution found, go back

sema = Semaphore(0) # For concurrency control using Semaphores

def calculate_fib(n):
    result = fib(n)
    print(f'Fibonacci of {n}: {result}')
    sema.V() # Let thread know task is done

def main():
    n = 30 # Lazy Evaluation: determining Fibonacci number of 30 when needed
    t = threading.Thread(target=calculate_fib, args=(n,)) # Concurrency: create a new thread for computation
    t.start()
    sema.P() # Wait for thread to finish

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Explanation:

Concurrency is the happening of at least two things at a given time and we use threads to achieve this. We introduced `calculate_fib()` function inside a thread which implies it can run alongside the main program. 

`Semaphore()` is used for concurrency control. `Semaphore.P()` is a method to acquire a lock whenever a certain shared data/operation is being used. `Semaphore.V()` is a method to release a lock after shared operation is done.



The Fibonacci function is a classic demonstration of memoization (to store the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when needed) and tabulation (bottom up DP approach). Here, we're using Python's lru_cache function decorator - a sort of "plug and play" approach to getting memoization for free.

Short-circuiting is demonstrated in the fib(n) function - if the function gets any input less than 2, it instantly  returns n, preventing unnecessary computation.

During the evaluation of the fib function, constraint propagation is used implicitly. The result of fib(n-2) and fib(n-1) are checked if they are None. If not, they get added and returned as a result. If any of them is None, the function returns None, which implies backtracking - no solution found, we need to go back.

Lazy evaluation is demonstrated in the main() function where the Fibonacci of number 30 gets evaluated when it is actually needed.

Using a rubric table format, please grade the student's answer with positive scoring. Each criterion is worth 1 point.

The criteria are: Correctly illustrates Lazy Evaluation & Short-Circuiting, Correctly illustrates Backtracking & Constraint Propagation, Correctly illustrates Memoization & Tabulation, Correctly illustrates Concurrency Control using Locks, Semaphores, CAS, Pertains to Concurrency, Text makes sense.

The table should only have the following columns: 'Criteria', 'Points Earned'. In the 'Points Earned' column, please provide only numerical values with no additional formatting. Please introduce the table with 'Here's the grading table:' and please include a row for 'Total Points Earned' at the end of the table. Finally, please start your grading explanation with 'Explanation':

Here's the grading table:

Explanation:

The student's solution effectively demonstrates all the required concepts.

Lazy Evaluation & Short-Circuiting is demonstrated in the main function and fib() function. The student waits to create a computation-heavy thread until it is needed (lazy evaluation), and then returns early from fib() when possible to prevent unnecessary computation (short-circuiting).

Backtracking & Constraint Propagation: The student also uses backtracking and constraint propagation concepts in the fib() function. The solution must satisfy both if conditions (constraint propagation). If it does not, the function returns None, representing the need to go back and try a different path (backtracking).

Memoization and Tabulation: The student's fib() function uses Python's built-in lru_cache for memoization, storing results of previous computations so they can be used again if needed. The use of past results to solve larger subproblems represents tabulation.

Concurrency Control: Using Semaphore’s P and V methods, the student demonstrates concurrency control. The semaphore P method is used to acquire a lock on a shared operation, and the V method is used to release the lock once the shared operation is done.

Finally, the student's solution pertains to concurrency, as required, and the provided explanation is clear and understandable. Therefore, the student has earned all the available points.
